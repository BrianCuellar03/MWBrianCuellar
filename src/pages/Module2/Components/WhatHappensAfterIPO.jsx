                        After a company completes its IPO, it transitions from private to public ownership, making its shares available for investors to buy.
                        In this first stage, called the primary market, companies raise funds directly by selling shares to investors.
                        Think of it as a bakery's grand opening, where customers can purchase special packages to support its growth.

                        After the primary market phase, shares enter the secondary market. Here, investors trade shares among themselves, without the company's direct involvement.
                        Itâ€™s like customers of the bakery exchanging recipes or tips after the grand opening. This is where the stock market truly comes alive.

                        The secondary market is where shares are traded among investors after the IPO. Prices here are shaped by market forces such as demand, investor sentiment, and broader trends.

                        In the secondary market, stock prices fluctuate based on various factors. Company performance, market trends, and investor behavior all contribute to price changes.
                        For instance, strong earnings might increase demand and drive up prices, while broader economic uncertainty could have the opposite effect.

                        Stock prices are influenced by company performance, economic indicators, market trends, and investor sentiment. These dynamics reflect how the market values a company over time.

                        Understanding what happens after an IPO illustrates how the stock market evolves beyond a company raising funds.
                        It shows how investors collectively shape the perception and value of companies, turning the market into a constantly shifting reflection of economic forces.
